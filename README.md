# Simple BDD Example

## How to run

### bdd-api (nodejs)
    cd bdd-api  
    npm install  
    node app.js  

### bddexample (java)
Open the project  
Run bddexample/src/test/java/RunCucumberTest (you should see that all test pass, make sure to run the api as the tests are calling the nodejs api). If you are running java 11 you might see a warning about the reflection syntax.
